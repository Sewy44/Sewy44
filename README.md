- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sewy44
- 👀 I’m interested in deepening my knowledge and experience. I've learned full stack web development and really enjoyed working on the backend, building databases and coding the server side. I'm open to input and critique on my repositories. Feel free to offer suggestions.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with SQL Server and C# with ASP.Net...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me to gain more experience, specifically wanting to dig in to .Net Core, go deeper with SQL Server, and strengthen my understanding of JavaScript.
